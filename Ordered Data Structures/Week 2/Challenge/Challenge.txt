Your job is to implement the function "int count(Node *n)" that computes and returns the number of nodes in the binary tree that has n as its root.

When you write your code below, assume that a class type called "Node" has already been defined for you; you cannot change the class definition. This class type has two child pointers ("left" , "right"). There is also a constructor Node() that initializes the children to nullptr and a destructor that deallocates the subtree's memory recursively.
